# Module 4 challenge

In this module challenge, we are provided with the PycitySchools folder. Inside the folder, we have a Python Jupyter notebook and 2 CSV files in the Resources folder. The schools_complete.csv file contains the details of all 15 schools in the district, and the students_complete.csv file includes the details of the student's grades and exam scores.

PyCitySchools.ipynb contains the code that we used for the analysis. District Summary and School Summary analysis are given inside the Jupyter Notebook header.
The rest of the analysis are as follows:

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

The school summary analysis already shows that the district charter schools perform highly compared to district schools. Within the charter school performances, we can see that the budget does not have much significance on the student's performances. Pena High School has the highest reading and math scores percentages, but the lower number of students affects the overall passing percentage.

## Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

From this analysis, we can see that the increasing number of students can be a factor in lower performances in the district schools. Per Student Budget is higher in district schools compared to charter schools. so we can assume that budget is not the problem for the low performances. Math productivity is lower in district schools, compared to their reading scores.

## Math and Reading Scores by Grade

Regardless of their grades, all students from the same school perform almost similarly in every grade. In Schools like Cabrera and Holden, all students are good in math. In this school district, every school performs high in reading, above 80% in all grades.

## Scores by School Spending

Cabrera, Holden, Wilson and Wright high schools are the low-budget schools and yet they perform very well in each categories. So we can say that the budget does not have an impact on school's performances. 

## Scores by School Size

When calculating the overall passing percentage, the number of students can affect the results. Bailey, Hernandez, Johnson are some of the schools with students above 4500. This can cause these schools to have a lower passing percentage. If we look at the scores we can see that Huang high school has the lowest math average score, 76.62% and  Ford and Rodriguez schools have the lowest reading scores, 80.74%. 

## Scores by School Type

This analysis clearly shows that charter schools perform better than district schools while operating on a lower budget. District Schools need to focus more on improving their math scores. 


# Acknowledgment

I have completed the challenge with the help of my Instructor and some internet searches.
